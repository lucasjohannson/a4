# deadlock detection - skeleton for Assignment 4

To compile all code, type:
```
$ make
```

To run the resulting code on file test1.txt:
```
$ ./deadlock < test1.txt
```

To run some built-in mini tests:
```
$ ./deadlock test
```

## IMPORTANT

Only modify and submit the `deadlock_detector.cpp` file. Your TAs will
supply their own versions of the other files (such as main.cpp) to
compile and test your code.
